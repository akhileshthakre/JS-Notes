What is Redux?
- Redux is a libraray for managing and updating the application state using event call "actions"
- It is serves as centralize stores for the state that need to use accross entire application
- It ensure that state only update in predctable fashion

Action - It ask us what to do?
		 It is a plain JS Object that have "type" field
		 It only tells what to do, but it dont tell how to do
		 Exa - 
			 export const number = (num) => {
				 return {
				 	type: 'ACTIONTYPE',
				 	payload: num
				 	}
			 	}

Reducer - contains current state of the Action
		- It has a powe to update the state
		- Reducers are function that take the current state and an action as arguments, and return a new state result
		Exa-
			const initialState = 0
			const changeNumber = (state = initialState, number) => {
				if(number.type == "ATIONTYPE") {
					return state + number.payload
				}else {
					return state - 1
				}
			}

Store - Object which holds the state of the applications
		It brings together the state,actions,reducers that make your app
		We can have only single store in our redux application
		Every Redux store can only have single rootReducer function
		Important functions -createStore()
							 dispatch(action)
							 getState()

		Exa -
			import {createStore} from "redux"
			const store = createStore(rootReducers)

Some Principles of Redux
- Single source of truth - means the global state of app stores as an object inside a single store
- State is read only - The only way to change the state is to dispatch an action
- Immutability, One-way data flow, Predictability and outcome
